`HW1.m` is considered to be the main file of project 1. Run it can detect the largest and smallest disks on the given graph.

`detect_largest_circle.m` is called when detecting the largest disks on the graph.

`detect_smallest_circle.m` is called when detecting the smallest disks on the graph.

`dilation.m` supports the operator of Minkowski addition with symmetric structuring element.

`erosion.m` supports the operator of Minkowski subtraction with symmetric stucturing element.

`RandomDisks-P10.jpg` is the given graph.
